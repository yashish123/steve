            Steven Paul Jobs February 24, 1955 â€“ October 5, 2011) was an American business magnate, industrial
            designer, investor, and media proprietor. He was the chairman, chief executive officer (CEO), and co-founder
            of
            Apple Inc.; the chairman and majority shareholder of Pixar; a member of The Walt Disney Company's board of
            directors following its acquisition of Pixar; and the founder, chairman, and CEO of NeXT. Jobs is widely
            recognized as a pioneer of the personal computer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s, along with his early
            business partner and fellow Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.

            Jobs was born in San Francisco, California, and put up for adoption. He was raised in the San Francisco Bay
            Area. He attended Reed College in 1972 before dropping out that same year, and traveled through India in
            1974
            seeking enlightenment and studying Zen Buddhism.

            Jobs and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. Together the duo
            gained
            fame and wealth a year later with the Apple II, one of the first highly successful mass-produced
            microcomputers.
            Jobs saw the commercial potential of the Xerox Alto in 1979, which was mouse-driven and had a graphical user
            interface (GUI). This led to the development of the unsuccessful Apple Lisa in 1983, followed by the
            breakthrough Macintosh in 1984, the first mass-produced computer with a GUI. The Macintosh introduced the
            desktop publishing industry in 1985 with the addition of the Apple LaserWriter, the first laser printer to
            feature vector graphics. Jobs was forced out of Apple in 1985 after a long power struggle with the company's
            board and its then-CEO John Sculley. That same year, Jobs took a few of Apple members with him to found
            NeXT, a
            computer platform development company that specialized in computers for higher-education and business
            markets.
            In addition, he helped to develop the visual effects industry when he funded the computer graphics division
            of
            George Lucas's Lucasfilm in 1986. The new company was Pixar, which produced the first 3D computer animated
            feature film Toy Story (1995), and went on to become a major animation studio, producing over 20 films since
            then.

            Jobs became CEO of Apple in 1997, following his company's acquisition of NeXT. He was largely responsible
            for
            helping revive Apple, which had been on the verge of bankruptcy. He worked closely with designer Jony Ive to
            develop a line of products that had larger cultural ramifications, beginning in 1997 with the "Think
            different"
            advertising campaign and leading to the iMac, iTunes, iTunes Store, Apple Store, iPod, iPhone, App Store,
            and
            the iPad. In 2001, the original Mac OS was replaced with the completely new Mac OS X (now known as macOS),
            based
            on NeXT's NeXTSTEP platform, giving the OS a modern Unix-based foundation for the first time. Jobs was
            diagnosed
            with a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor in 2003. He died of respiratory arrest related to the tumor at age 56
            on
            October 5, 2011.
